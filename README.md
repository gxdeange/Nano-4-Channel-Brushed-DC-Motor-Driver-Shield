# Nano-Motor-Driver-Shield
Low voltage 4 Channel Motor Driver board the allows an Arduino Nano to plug on top

Drive pins are D3, D5, D7 and D9
Power is derived from the Nano 5V pin

This image is the Prototype and there will be two Low volateg variants in the near future:

1: Power is derived from the Nano or,
2: The driver board has a USB mini connector and feeds 5V to the VIN pin on the Nano
